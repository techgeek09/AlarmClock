# AlarmClock
<h6>This Python application allows users to set an alarm time in the format "HH:MM". Once the alarm is set and the user clicks "Set Alarm", the program continuously checks the current time against the set alarm time. When the current time matches the alarm time, it displays a message "Time to wake up!" and plays a beep sound for 1 second.</h6>

<h4>Key Features:</h4>
<h6>GUI Interface: Utilizes "tkinter" for creating a simple graphical user interface with labels, entry fields, and buttons.</h6>
<h6>Alarm Setting: Users can input the alarm time in "HH:MM" format via an entry field.</h6>
<h6>Alarm Trigger: Continuously checks the system time against the set alarm time and triggers an alert when they match.</h6>
<h6>Audible Notification: Plays a beep sound ("winsound.Beep") to notify the user when the alarm goes off.</h6>
<h4>Usage:</h4>
<h5>Run the script and enter the desired alarm time in the provided format.</h5>
<h5>Click "Set Alarm" to activate the alarm.</h5>
<h5>The program will monitor the current time and alert the user when it matches the set alarm time.</h5>
<h6>Purpose:</h6>
<h4>This project serves as a basic demonstration of how to create a functional alarm clock application using Python and "tkinter", suitable for learning GUI programming and basic time handling in Python.</h4>

<h5>Note:</h5>
<h4>Ensure you have the necessary modules ("tkinter", "time", and "winsound") installed in your Python environment to run the application successfully.</h4>
